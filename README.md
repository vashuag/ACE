# EnviroAgent - The Agent That Shapes Your World for Success

An AI agent that interacts with your environment to increase the chances of goal completion. Transform your goals into reality with intelligent AI that adapts your world for success.

## 🧠 Vision

To build intelligent AI agents that not only understand human goals — but actively interact with and adapt the user's environment to help them achieve those goals faster, smarter, and more efficiently.

> "Instead of humans adapting to technology, EnviroAgent makes technology adapt to humans."

## 🚀 What is EnviroAgent?

EnviroAgent is an AI-driven system that bridges the gap between human intent and the environment we live in — digital or physical.

Unlike traditional assistants (like Siri, Alexa, or ChatGPT) that only respond to commands, EnviroAgent acts — it dynamically reshapes your digital ecosystem, devices, and workflows to optimize the conditions for achieving your goal.

Think of it as your Goal Execution Companion — an AI that doesn't just remind you what to do, but actually creates the conditions that help you do it.
